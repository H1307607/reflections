When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When I work on more than one computer or few people (including me) work on the same project
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	to have more controle what will be push and fetch to/from Github
