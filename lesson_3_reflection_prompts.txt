When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	When I work on more than one computer or few people (including me) work on the same project
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	To have more controle what will be push and fetch to/from Github

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Branch is a paralell version of my commits. Clone is a exact copy (clon of repository) is
	created  from remote or local repository. Frok is e clone of refository make from Github
	to onother Github acouunt

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

	That was my question wen i start advetures with programing and now I know that would be really hard
	without those tools.
